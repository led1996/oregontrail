1. Find a Python Code of the game to use as a Basis of the project. The outcome should be a base code for the project. -DONE 
2. Look at the code, and evaluate the code. I will make sure that the code is working and effective to where I can use it. -DONE
3. Run the Code to see how the game will function. I will use that as a basis to see what I can change, what can be improved, and what can stay the same. -DONE
4. Start tinkering with the code. Add a display function for the different options on your trail. 
5. Find a way to add to the options on the trail. 
6. Write the code for the options i decided to add. 
7. Test the code that I added to the base code to make sure it runs smoothly. 
8. If code does not work, check what is wrong with it, and ask for help if needed. 
9. Implement all the codes into final code game. 
10. Have a friend test the code to make sure that it is working and ask for feedback. 
11. Use Feedback to improve code. 
12. Implement final Codes to the game and finish the project.
